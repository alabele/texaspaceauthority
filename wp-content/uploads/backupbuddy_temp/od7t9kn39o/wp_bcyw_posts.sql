INSERT INTO `wp_bcyw_posts` VALUES('238', '1', '2015-04-29 23:46:51', '2015-04-29 23:46:51', 'Originally <a href=\"http://cleantx.org/property-assessed-clean-energy-pace-financing-comes-to-texas/\">posted on CleanTX</a>:\n\nMarch 24<sup>th</sup> marked a milestone for Texas’ clean energy economy. On that day, Travis County voted to adopt a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, making it the first county in Texas to do so. By adopting PACE, Travis County has unlocked a powerful economic mechanism for financing energy/water efficiency and clean energy technologies in upgrading Texas buildings.\n\n<strong>What is PACE?</strong>\n\nPACE, enacted in the 2013 Texas Legislature with support from both sides of the aisle, has the potential to unlock a considerable amount of private funding for clean energy and water conservation projects in the state. Specifically, PACE is an innovative financing program—completely free of government mandates and public funding–that enables commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy-efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Participants will then repay these loans through a county assessment on the property.\n\nA PACE loan simultaneously offers building owners cheaper financing options and lenders secure repayment terms. In exchange for funds provided by a private lender to pay for the project, the property owner voluntarily requests that the local government place an assessment secured with a senior lien on the property until the assessment is paid in full.\n\n<strong>Benefits to Businesses</strong>\n\nPACE has great potential to directly affect the bottom lines of small and medium sized businesses. To be eligible for PACE financing, a project must show that the savings in utility costs will offset the cost of the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\n\nNationally, almost 75 percent of PACE projects were less than <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/pace-data/\">$250,000</a> in size, demonstrating PACE’s popularity as a tool for small and medium-size businesses. Further, these project installations lead to increased property value and lower utility bills, making PACE projects attractive for both property owners and tenants alike.\n\n<strong>State Program, County Project, Local Support</strong>\n\nTravis County Commissioners Gerald Daugherty (R) and Brigid Shea (D) united to cosponsor the resolution advocated since 2012 by County Tax Assessor Collector Bruce Elfant with tremendous support from a large local coalition of PACE advocates in Travis County.\n\nThis means that within the next several weeks, private funding for water and energy efficiency upgrades as well as renewable energy projects in Travis County will be unleashed for local businesses. This program will be administered by the nonprofit Texas PACE Authority, an organization created to administer PACE programs in an efficient, low-cost manner – facilitating a marketplace for lenders, property owners, and contractors to put together financially sensible building upgrade projects.\n\n<strong>The Future of PACE in Texas</strong>\n\nTexas now has its first PACE program. But it shouldn’t stop here in Travis County. The state of Texas accounts for <a href=\"http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/texas-an-energy-and-economic-analysis/\">12 percent</a> of the entire country’s energy use, and Texas’ unique PACE framework makes implementation across the state easy and predictable. In the next few months, we’ll be looking to help other counties follow with uniform PACE programs of their own.\n\n<a href=\"http://cleantx.org/event/cleantx-forum-keeping-pace-texas/\" target=\"_blank\">cleantx.org/event/cleantx-forum-keeping-pace-texas/</a>', 'PACE Forum with CleanTX', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '61-autosave-v1', '', '', '2015-04-29 23:46:51', '2015-04-29 23:46:51', '', '61', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/?p=238', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

These improvements can be structured to generate positive cash flow to the property owner because the cost savings derived from them exceeds the amount of the PACE assessment payment. In addition, PACE enables the property owner to amortize the cost of the improvements over their useful life. Inasmuch as PACE loans are secured by assessments on the property, they are automatically transferred to successive owners when the property is sold. Consequently, each owner of the property pays only that portion of the assessment that accrues during its period of ownership. And importantly for property owners leasing their property to tenants, PACE assessments can be passed to tenants under the typical commercial office lease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">These attributes of PACE loans enable property owners to overcome traditional barriers to making capital investments in property. Without PACE, property owners will continue tossing the problem of delayed maintenance on their property’s aging physical plant to a new owner like a hot potato. Until committing capital to modernize real property infrastructure makes sense as a value proposition, property owners will continue to waste operating expenditures on utility bills and risk exposure to utility price increases. Instead, PACE users capitalize money previously spent on utilities; the utility cost savings achieved by a retrofit pay for the retrofit itself. Property owners end up with more valuable property and access to recurring utility savings and pay only for the assessments that accrue while they own the property.</p>\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"What is the Contract I Will Have to Sign?\" style=\"fancy\"]\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">As part of a PACE project, you will sign a contract with the local government where you as the property owner voluntarily consent to having an assessment placed on your property, as a means of paying for you building upgrades.

PACE assessments provide lenders with an attractive new product to assist existing and new customers in addressing an almost universal pent-up demand for needed commercial and industrial property equipment modernization.

These improvements can be structured to generate positive cash flow to the property owner because the cost savings derived from them exceeds the amount of the PACE assessment payment. In addition, PACE enables the property owner to amortize the cost of the improvements over their useful life. Inasmuch as PACE loans are secured by assessments on the property, they are automatically transferred to successive owners when the property is sold. Consequently, each owner of the property pays only that portion of the assessment that accrues during its period of ownership. And importantly for property owners leasing their property to tenants, PACE assessments can be passed to tenants under the typical commercial office lease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">These attributes of PACE loans enable property owners to overcome traditional barriers to making capital investments in property. Without PACE, property owners will continue tossing the problem of delayed maintenance on their property’s aging physical plant to a new owner like a hot potato. Until committing capital to modernize real property infrastructure makes sense as a value proposition, property owners will continue to waste operating expenditures on utility bills and risk exposure to utility price increases. Instead, PACE users capitalize money previously spent on utilities; the utility cost savings achieved by a retrofit pay for the retrofit itself. Property owners end up with more valuable property and access to recurring utility savings and pay only for the assessments that accrue while they own the property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">The  Texas PACE Authority has partnered with the US Green Building Council in providing a list of PACE Service Providers, which may be found by clicking the button to the side.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\"><em>DISCLAIMER: TPA neither endorses nor recommend any particular service providers, including those found in the US GBC Directory.

On that day, Travis County voted to adopt a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, making it the first county in Texas to do so. By adopting PACE, Travis County has unlocked a powerful economic mechanism for financing energy/water efficiency and clean energy technologies in upgrading Texas buildings.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is PACE?</strong>\r\n\r\nPACE, enacted in the 2013 Texas Legislature with support from both sides of the aisle, has the potential to unlock a considerable amount of private funding for clean energy and water conservation projects in the state. Specifically, PACE is an innovative financing program—completely free of government mandates and public funding–that enables commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy-efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Participants will then repay these loans through a county assessment on the property.\r\n\r\nA PACE loan simultaneously offers building owners cheaper financing options and lenders secure repayment terms. In exchange for funds provided by a private lender to pay for the project, the property owner voluntarily requests that the local government place an assessment secured with a senior lien on the property until the assessment is paid in full.\r\n\r\n<strong>Benefits to Businesses</strong>\r\n\r\nPACE has great potential to directly affect the bottom lines of small and medium sized businesses. To be eligible for PACE financing, a project must show that the savings in utility costs will offset the cost of the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nNationally, almost 75 percent of PACE projects were less than <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/pace-data/\">$250,000</a> in size, demonstrating PACE’s popularity as a tool for small and medium-size businesses. Further, these project installations lead to increased property value and lower utility bills, making PACE projects attractive for both property owners and tenants alike.\r\n\r\n<strong>State Program, County Project, Local Support</strong>\r\n\r\nTravis County Commissioners Gerald Daugherty (R) and Brigid Shea (D) united to cosponsor the resolution advocated since 2012 by County Tax Assessor Collector Bruce Elfant with tremendous support from a large local coalition of PACE advocates in Travis County.\r\n\r\nThis means that within the next several weeks, private funding for water and energy efficiency upgrades as well as renewable energy projects in Travis County will be unleashed for local businesses. This program will be administered by the nonprofit Texas PACE Authority, an organization created to administer PACE programs in an efficient, low-cost manner – facilitating a marketplace for lenders, property owners, and contractors to put together financially sensible building upgrade projects.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Future of PACE in Texas</strong>\r\n\r\nTexas now has its first PACE program. But it shouldn’t stop here in Travis County. The state of Texas accounts for <a href=\"http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/texas-an-energy-and-economic-analysis/\">12 percent</a> of the entire country’s energy use, and Texas’ unique PACE framework makes implementation across the state easy and predictable. In the next few months, we’ll be looking to help other counties follow with uniform PACE programs of their own.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Texas PACE Authority would like to thank:</strong>\r\n<center><table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"300px\"><img class=\" wp-image-369 size-medium\" style=\"padding: 30px;\" src=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/austin-energy-300x173.jpg\" alt=\"austin-energy\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" /></td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" height=\"300px\">and</td>\r\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" height=\"300px\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-370 aligncenter\" style=\"padding: 30px;\" src=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/petros-logo.png\" alt=\"petros-logo\" width=\"207\" height=\"28\" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan=\"3\">for hosting the Texas PACE Authority Launch event on April 28th, 2015.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table></center>', 'PACE Forum with CleanTX', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'eligibility-screening-tool', '', '', '2015-05-07 20:41:50', '2015-05-07 20:41:50', '', '0', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/?p=61', '0', 'post', '', '0');

These improvements can be structured to generate positive cash flow to the property owner because the cost savings derived from them exceeds the amount of the PACE assessment payment. In addition, PACE enables the property owner to amortize the cost of the improvements over their useful life. Inasmuch as PACE loans are secured by assessments on the property, they are automatically transferred to successive owners when the property is sold. Consequently, each owner of the property pays only that portion of the assessment that accrues during its period of ownership. And importantly for property owners leasing their property to tenants, PACE assessments can be passed to tenants under the typical commercial office lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">These attributes of PACE loans enable property owners to overcome traditional barriers to making capital investments in property. Without PACE, property owners will continue tossing the problem of delayed maintenance on their property’s aging physical plant to a new owner like a hot potato. Until committing capital to modernize real property infrastructure makes sense as a value proposition, property owners will continue to waste operating expenditures on utility bills and risk exposure to utility price increases. Instead, PACE users capitalize money previously spent on utilities; the utility cost savings achieved by a retrofit pay for the retrofit itself. Property owners end up with more valuable property and access to recurring utility savings and pay only for the assessments that accrue while they own the property.</p>\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"What is the Contract I Will Have to Sign?\" style=\"fancy\"]\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">As part of a PACE project, you will sign a contract with the local government where you as the property owner voluntarily consent to having an assessment placed on your property, as a means of paying for you building upgrades.

On that day, Travis County voted to adopt a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, making it the first county in Texas to do so. By adopting PACE, Travis County has unlocked a powerful economic mechanism for financing energy/water efficiency and clean energy technologies in upgrading Texas buildings.\n\n<strong>What is PACE?</strong>\n\nPACE, enacted in the 2013 Texas Legislature with support from both sides of the aisle, has the potential to unlock a considerable amount of private funding for clean energy and water conservation projects in the state. Specifically, PACE is an innovative financing program—completely free of government mandates and public funding–that enables commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy-efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Participants will then repay these loans through a county assessment on the property.\n\nA PACE loan simultaneously offers building owners cheaper financing options and lenders secure repayment terms. In exchange for funds provided by a private lender to pay for the project, the property owner voluntarily requests that the local government place an assessment secured with a senior lien on the property until the assessment is paid in full.\n\n<strong>Benefits to Businesses</strong>\n\nPACE has great potential to directly affect the bottom lines of small and medium sized businesses. To be eligible for PACE financing, a project must show that the savings in utility costs will offset the cost of the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\n\nNationally, almost 75 percent of PACE projects were less than <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/pace-data/\">$250,000</a> in size, demonstrating PACE’s popularity as a tool for small and medium-size businesses. Further, these project installations lead to increased property value and lower utility bills, making PACE projects attractive for both property owners and tenants alike.\n\n<strong>State Program, County Project, Local Support</strong>\n\nTravis County Commissioners Gerald Daugherty (R) and Brigid Shea (D) united to cosponsor the resolution advocated since 2012 by County Tax Assessor Collector Bruce Elfant with tremendous support from a large local coalition of PACE advocates in Travis County.\n\nThis means that within the next several weeks, private funding for water and energy efficiency upgrades as well as renewable energy projects in Travis County will be unleashed for local businesses. This program will be administered by the nonprofit Texas PACE Authority, an organization created to administer PACE programs in an efficient, low-cost manner – facilitating a marketplace for lenders, property owners, and contractors to put together financially sensible building upgrade projects.\n\n<strong>The Future of PACE in Texas</strong>\n\nTexas now has its first PACE program. But it shouldn’t stop here in Travis County. The state of Texas accounts for <a href=\"http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/texas-an-energy-and-economic-analysis/\">12 percent</a> of the entire country’s energy use, and Texas’ unique PACE framework makes implementation across the state easy and predictable. In the next few months, we’ll be looking to help other counties follow with uniform PACE programs of their own.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Texas PACE Authority would like to thank:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td height=\"300px\"><img class=\" wp-image-369 size-medium\" style=\"padding: 30px;\" src=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/austin-energy-300x173.jpg\" alt=\"austin-energy\" width=\"300\" height=\"173\" /></td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" height=\"300px\">and</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" height=\"300px\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-370 aligncenter\" style=\"padding: 30px;\" src=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/petros-logo.png\" alt=\"petros-logo\" width=\"207\" height=\"28\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>for hosting the Texas PACE Authority Launch event on April 28th, 2015.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>', 'PACE Forum with CleanTX', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '61-autosave-v1', '', '', '2015-05-07 20:40:38', '2015-05-07 20:40:38', '', '61', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/?p=97', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Participants will then repay those loans through a property assessment.\r\n\r\nPACE has great potential to directly affect the bottom lines of small and medium sized businesses. To be eligible for PACE financing, a project must show that the savings in utility costs will offset the cost of installing the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nThe Texas PACE Authority is a non-profit organization that administers Texas’ new PACE statute by taking a market-based approach to energy finance and economic development.

This includes things such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Insulation</li>\r\n	<li>High-efficiency windows or doors</li>\r\n	<li>Automated energy control systems</li>\r\n	<li>HVAC modification or replacement</li>\r\n	<li>Caulking, weather-stripping or air sealing</li>\r\n	<li>Light fixture modifications</li>\r\n	<li>Water use efficiency improvements</li>\r\n	<li>Energy- or water-efficient manufacturing processes and/or equipment</li>\r\n	<li>Solar panels</li>\r\n	<li>Solar hot water</li>\r\n	<li>Gray water reuse</li>\r\n	<li>Rainwater collection system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe encourage you to explore approach improvements on a holistic basis to gain maximum efficiency using PACE. Consider upgrading your facility\'s envelope first to get maximum savings from your retrofit.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a project in mind, take our Eligibility Assessment to see if your project might qualify.\r\n\r\n[su_button url=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/?page_id=17\" target=\"blank\" style=\"flat\" background=\"#29789A\" size=\"7\" center=\"yes\" radius=\"0\" icon=\"icon: check\"]Eligibility Screening Tool[/su_button]\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"2.

Like a property tax lien, the assessment lien securing the PACE loan has priority over other liens on the property. Therefore, the risk of loss from non-payment of a PACE loan is insignificant compared to most other types of loans. PACE assessments provide lenders with an attractive new product to assist existing and new customers in addressing an almost universal pent-up demand for needed commercial and industrial property equipment modernization.

We\'re facilitating an open-market PACE initiative in Texas to make property more energy and water efficient.\r\n\r\nPACE is an innovative financing program that enables commercial, industrial, large multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term financing for water conservation, energy- efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Participants will then repay those loans through a property assessment imposed by the local government at the request of the property owner.\r\n\r\nPACE has great potential to directly affect a business\' bottom lines; a project\'s savings in utility costs offsets the cost of installing the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nThe Texas PACE Authority is a non-profit organization that administers Texas’ new PACE statute by taking a market-based approach to energy finance and economic development. We look forward to working with all parties involved - property owners, contractors, and lenders - in bringing energy and water improvements that are both economically sound and environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\nWhere is PACE Financing available in Texas?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Travis County - April 2015</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInterested in having a PACE program in your area?

These improvements can be structured to generate positive cash flow to the property owner because the cost savings derived from them exceeds the amount of the PACE assessment payment. In addition, PACE enables the property owner to amortize the cost of the improvements over their useful life. Inasmuch as PACE loans are secured by assessments on the property, they are automatically transferred to successive owners when the property is sold. Consequently, each owner of the property pays only that portion of the assessment that accrues during its period of ownership. And importantly for property owners leasing their property to tenants, PACE assessments can be passed to tenants under the typical commercial office lease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">These attributes of PACE loans enable property owners to overcome traditional barriers to making capital investments in property. Without PACE, property owners will continue tossing the problem of delayed maintenance on their property’s aging physical plant to a new owner like a hot potato. Until committing capital to modernize real property infrastructure makes sense as a value proposition, property owners will continue to waste operating expenditures on utility bills and risk exposure to utility price increases. Instead, PACE users capitalize money previously spent on utilities; the utility cost savings achieved by a retrofit pay for the retrofit itself. Property owners end up with more valuable property and access to recurring utility savings and pay only for the assessments that accrue while they own the property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">The  Texas PACE Authority has partnered with the US Green Building Council in providing a list of PACE Service Providers, which may be found by clicking here:</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\"><a href=\"http://texasgreenbuildingmarketplace.org/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Texas_GreenBuilding_Marketplace_440-300x169.png\" alt=\"Texas Green Building Marketplace Logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\"><em>DISCLAIMER: Texas PACE Authority neither endorses nor recommends any particular service providers, including those found in the USGBC Directory.

On that day, Travis County voted to adopt a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program, making it the first county in Texas to do so. By adopting PACE, Travis County has unlocked a powerful economic mechanism for financing energy/water efficiency and clean energy technologies in upgrading Texas buildings.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is PACE?</strong>\r\n\r\nPACE, enacted in the 2013 Texas Legislature with support from both sides of the aisle, has the potential to unlock a considerable amount of private funding for clean energy and water conservation projects in the state. Specifically, PACE is an innovative financing program—completely free of government mandates and public funding–that enables commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy-efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Participants will then repay these loans through a county assessment on the property.\r\n\r\nA PACE loan simultaneously offers building owners cheaper financing options and lenders secure repayment terms. In exchange for funds provided by a private lender to pay for the project, the property owner voluntarily requests that the local government place an assessment secured with a senior lien on the property until the assessment is paid in full.\r\n\r\n<strong>Benefits to Businesses</strong>\r\n\r\nPACE has great potential to directly affect the bottom lines of small and medium sized businesses. To be eligible for PACE financing, a project must show that the savings in utility costs will offset the cost of the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nNationally, almost 75 percent of PACE projects were less than <a href=\"http://www.pacenow.org/pace-data/\">$250,000</a> in size, demonstrating PACE’s popularity as a tool for small and medium-size businesses. Further, these project installations lead to increased property value and lower utility bills, making PACE projects attractive for both property owners and tenants alike.\r\n\r\n<strong>State Program, County Project, Local Support</strong>\r\n\r\nTravis County Commissioners Gerald Daugherty (R) and Brigid Shea (D) united to cosponsor the resolution advocated since 2012 by County Tax Assessor Collector Bruce Elfant with tremendous support from a large local coalition of PACE advocates in Travis County.\r\n\r\nThis means that within the next several weeks, private funding for water and energy efficiency upgrades as well as renewable energy projects in Travis County will be unleashed for local businesses. This program will be administered by the nonprofit Texas PACE Authority, an organization created to administer PACE programs in an efficient, low-cost manner – facilitating a marketplace for lenders, property owners, and contractors to put together financially sensible building upgrade projects.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Future of PACE in Texas</strong>\r\n\r\nTexas now has its first PACE program. But it shouldn’t stop here in Travis County. The state of Texas accounts for <a href=\"http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/texas-an-energy-and-economic-analysis/\">12 percent</a> of the entire country’s energy use, and Texas’ unique PACE framework makes implementation across the state easy and predictable. In the next few months, we’ll be looking to help other counties follow with uniform PACE programs of their own.', 'PACE Forum with CleanTX', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '61-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-29 23:47:06', '2015-04-29 23:47:06', '', '61', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/?p=299', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

These improvements can be structured to generate positive cash flow to the property owner because the cost savings derived from them exceeds the amount of the PACE assessment payment. In addition, PACE enables the property owner to amortize the cost of the improvements over their useful life. Inasmuch as PACE loans are secured by assessments on the property, they are automatically transferred to successive owners when the property is sold. Consequently, each owner of the property pays only that portion of the assessment that accrues during its period of ownership. And importantly for property owners leasing their property to tenants, PACE assessments can be passed to tenants under the typical commercial office lease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">These attributes of PACE loans enable property owners to overcome traditional barriers to making capital investments in property. Without PACE, property owners will continue tossing the problem of delayed maintenance on their property’s aging physical plant to a new owner like a hot potato. Until committing capital to modernize real property infrastructure makes sense as a value proposition, property owners will continue to waste operating expenditures on utility bills and risk exposure to utility price increases. Instead, PACE users capitalize money previously spent on utilities; the utility cost savings achieved by a retrofit pay for the retrofit itself. Property owners end up with more valuable property and access to recurring utility savings and pay only for the assessments that accrue while they own the property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">The  Texas PACE Authority has partnered with the US Green Building Council in providing a list of PACE Service Providers, which may be found by clicking here:</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\"><a href=\"http://texasgreenbuildingmarketplace.org/listing/guide/pace-related\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-171 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Texas_GreenBuilding_Marketplace_440-300x169.png\" alt=\"Texas Green Building Marketplace Logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\"><em>DISCLAIMER: Texas PACE Authority neither endorses nor recommends any particular service providers, including those found in the USGBC Directory.

In addition, the ITPR should have at least one of the following certifications:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Building Energy Assessment Professional (BEAP)</li>\r\n	<li>Building Energy Modeling Professional</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Association of Energy Engineers (AEE)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Certified Energy Manager (CEM)</li>\r\n	<li>Certified Measurement and Verification Professional (CMVP)</li>\r\n	<li>Certified Energy Auditor (CEA)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li>Building Commissioning Association\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Certified Commissioning Professional</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"7.

These improvements can be structured to generate positive cash flow to the property owner because the cost savings derived from them exceeds the amount of the PACE assessment payment. In addition, PACE enables the property owner to amortize the cost of the improvements over their useful life. Inasmuch as PACE loans are secured by assessments on the property, they are automatically transferred to successive owners when the property is sold. Consequently, each owner of the property pays only that portion of the assessment that accrues during its period of ownership. And importantly for property owners leasing their property to tenants, PACE assessments can be passed to tenants under the typical commercial office lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">These attributes of PACE loans enable property owners to overcome traditional barriers to making capital investments in property. Without PACE, property owners will continue tossing the problem of delayed maintenance on their property’s aging physical plant to a new owner like a hot potato. Until committing capital to modernize real property infrastructure makes sense as a value proposition, property owners will continue to waste operating expenditures on utility bills and risk exposure to utility price increases. Instead, PACE users capitalize money previously spent on utilities; the utility cost savings achieved by a retrofit pay for the retrofit itself. Property owners end up with more valuable property and access to recurring utility savings and pay only for the assessments that accrue while they own the property.</p>\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"What is the Contract I Will Have to Sign?\" style=\"fancy\"]\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">As part of a PACE project, you will sign a contract with the local government where you as the property owner voluntarily consent to having an assessment placed on your property, as a means of paying for you building upgrades.

To be of value, the work of the ITPR must be both professionally qualified and without conflict or relationship to the project they are reviewing. An ITPR must be a licensed Professional Engineer with energy/water efficiency experience. Additionally, the Professional Engineer should have at least one of the following certifications:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Building Energy Assessment Professional (BEAP)</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Building Energy Modeling Professional</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Association of Energy Engineers (AEE)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Energy Manager (CEM)</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Measurement and Verification Professional (CMVP)</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Energy Auditor (CEA)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Building Commissioning Association\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Commissioning Professional</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">In the long term, all projects will be required to follow protocols developed by the Investor Confidence Project (ICP).

Like a property tax lien, the assessment lien securing the PACE loan has priority over other liens on the property. Therefore, the risk of loss from non-payment of a PACE loan is minimal compared to most other types of loans. PACE assessments provide lenders with an attractive new product to assist existing and new customers in addressing an almost universal pent-up demand for needed commercial and industrial property equipment modernization. In order to protect the interests of holders of existing mortgage loans on the property, the PACE Act requires their written consent to the PACE assessment as a condition to obtaining a PACE loan.</p>\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"Why would I ever consent to a senior lien on my collateral?\" style=\"fancy\"]\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">If your client wants to do a PACE project, they will need your consent to put an assessment in place.

Like a property tax lien, the assessment lien securing the PACE loan has priority over other liens on the property. Therefore, the risk of loss from non-payment of a PACE loan is minimal compared to most other types of loans. PACE assessments provide lenders with an attractive new product to assist existing and new customers in addressing an almost universal pent-up demand for needed commercial and industrial property equipment modernization. In order to protect the interests of holders of existing mortgage loans on the property, the PACE Act requires their written consent to the PACE assessment as a condition to obtaining a PACE loan.</p>\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"Why would I ever consent to a senior lien on my collateral?\" style=\"fancy\"]\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">If your client wants to do a PACE project, they will need your consent to put an assessment in place.

Decide on a Project\" style=\"fancy\"]\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to decide what energy/water efficiency measures you want to install. Generally, a PACE project must demonstrably reduce your energy/water consumption or generate distributed energy. This includes things such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Insulation</li>\r\n	<li>High-efficiency windows or doors</li>\r\n	<li>Automated energy control systems</li>\r\n	<li>HVAC modification or replacement</li>\r\n	<li>Caulking, weather-stripping or air sealing</li>\r\n	<li>Light fixture modifications</li>\r\n	<li>Water use efficiency improvements</li>\r\n	<li>Energy- or water-efficient manufacturing processes and/or equipment</li>\r\n	<li>Solar panels</li>\r\n	<li>Solar hot water</li>\r\n	<li>Gray water reuse</li>\r\n	<li>Rainwater collection system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe encourage you to approach improvements on a holistic basis to gain maximum efficiency using PACE. Consider upgrading your facility\'s envelope first to get maximum savings from your retrofit.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a project in mind, take our Eligibility Assessment to see if your project might qualify.\r\n\r\n[su_button url=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/?page_id=17\" target=\"blank\" style=\"flat\" background=\"#29789A\" size=\"7\" center=\"yes\" radius=\"0\" icon=\"icon: check\"]Eligibility Screening Tool[/su_button]\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"2.

In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nThe Texas PACE Authority is a non-profit organization that administers Texas’ new PACE statute by taking a market-based approach to energy finance and economic development.

These improvements can be structured to generate positive cash flow to the property owner because the cost savings derived from them exceeds the amount of the PACE assessment payment. In addition, PACE enables the property owner to amortize the cost of the improvements over their useful life. Inasmuch as PACE loans are secured by assessments on the property, they are automatically transferred to successive owners when the property is sold. Consequently, each owner of the property pays only that portion of the assessment that accrues during its period of ownership. And importantly for property owners leasing their property to tenants, PACE assessments can be passed to tenants under the typical commercial office lease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">These attributes of PACE loans enable property owners to overcome traditional barriers to making capital investments in property. Without PACE, property owners will continue tossing the problem of delayed maintenance on their property’s aging physical plant to a new owner like a hot potato. Until committing capital to modernize real property infrastructure makes sense as a value proposition, property owners will continue to waste operating expenditures on utility bills and risk exposure to utility price increases. Instead, PACE users capitalize money previously spent on utilities; the utility cost savings achieved by a retrofit pay for the retrofit itself. Property owners end up with more valuable property and access to recurring utility savings and pay only for the assessments that accrue while they own the property.</p>\r\n[/su_spoiler] [/su_accordion]\r\n\r\n[su_accordion]\r\n[su_spoiler title=\"What is the Contract I Will Have to Sign?\" style=\"fancy\"]\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">As part of a PACE project, you will sign a contract with the local government where you as the property owner voluntarily consent to having an assessment placed on your property, as a means of paying for you building upgrades.

We\'re facilitating an open-market PACE initiative in Texas to make property more energy and water efficient.\r\n\r\nPACE is an innovative financing program that enables commercial, industrial, large multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term financing for water conservation, energy- efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Participants will then repay those loans through a property assessment imposed by the local government at the request of the property owner.\r\n\r\nPACE has great potential to directly affect a business\' bottom lines; a project\'s savings in utility costs offsets the cost of installing the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nThe Texas PACE Authority is a non-profit organization that administers Texas’ new PACE statute by taking a market-based approach to energy finance and economic development. We look forward to working with all parties involved - property owners, contractors, and lenders - in bringing energy and water improvements that are both economically sound and environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\nWhere is PACE Financing available in Texas?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Travis County - April 2015</li>\r\n        <li>City of Houston (including ETJ) - November 2015</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInterested in having a PACE program in your area?

Additionally, the Professional Engineer should have at least one of the following certifications:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Building Energy Assessment Professional (BEAP)</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Building Energy Modeling Professional</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Association of Energy Engineers (AEE)\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Energy Manager (CEM)</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Measurement and Verification Professional (CMVP)</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Energy Auditor (CEA)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Building Commissioning Association\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"font_8\">Certified Commissioning Professional</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"font_8\">In the long term, all projects will be required to follow protocols developed by the Investor Confidence Project (ICP).

Skyrocketing energy bills made temple officials realize how much they also needed more insulation for the wall of windows in its auditorium. Price for upgrades: $450,000.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Travis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea along with county Tax Assessor-Collector Bruce Elfant announced in a news conference that Congregation Beth Israel will receive what they need as Texas’ first PACE recipient.\r\n\r\nPACE, which stands for Property Assessed Clean Energy, is an innovative financing program – completely free of government mandates and public funding – that enables non-profit, commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain up to 100 percent of the project financing from low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Repayments of the loans pass through the county tax office to the lenders.\r\n\r\nAustin\'s Petros PACE Finance, LLC, gave Congregation Beth Israel 100 percent of the financing it needed. Petros is one of the first specialty finance firms in the nation dedicated to the commercial PACE market, previously providing financing for PACE projects in Michigan.\r\n\r\n“Closing the first PACE project in our home state is especially significant for us,” said Mansoor Ghori, CEO of Petros PACE Finance, LLC. “We enjoyed working with the team at Congregation Beth Israel and are proud they were the first of many here in Travis County.\"\r\n\r\nThe Way Companies developed the temple project and will replace two air-cooled chilled water machines and two heating water boilers, apply window films and extend the building automation and control system to the new equipment. The improvement will reduce the temple’s operating and utility costs in its educational wing.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Texas Legislature passed the program, which allows local governments to approve its use. The Travis County Commissioners Court became the first government entity in the state to embrace the program in March 2015.\r\n\r\n“It is a credit to the Texas Legislature and the Travis County Commissioners Court that our county is the first in Texas to offer an affordable way for business property owners to reduce their environmental impact and upgrade their properties,” Elfant said. “It is economically beneficial for business and good for the environment, and today it is exciting to publicly announce that Congregation Beth Israel is the first in Texas to take advantage of this program.”\r\n\r\nInstead of shelling out $15,000 a year or more to fix a substandard heating and cooling system, Congregation Beth Israel expects its new upgrades to save $35,000 annually in energy costs.\r\n\r\nRabbi Steven Folberg, the temple’s spiritual leader, recalled a well-known Jewish quote from the Babylonian Talmud that says: You’re not required to complete the work, but neither are you free to abstain from it.\r\n\r\n“While no single individual, organization or community can complete the task of Tikkun Olam, mending and transforming the world, we all must take responsibility and play our part,” Folberg said during the news conference. “Reducing our congregation’s carbon footprint and living with lightened impact on God’s earth through the vision and ingenuity of the PACE program not only makes economic sense, but also represents a sacred act of both responsibility and hope in the future.”\r\n\r\nCharlene Heydinger, executive director of Keeping PACE in Texas, a non-profit business association that led the PACE legislative effort and created the Texas PACE program model, called \"PACE in Box,\" said many people focus on the program\'s value for multi-million-dollar projects for big business.\r\n\r\n“It certainly helps large-scale commercial and industrial property owners with delayed maintenance issues, but it also applies to non-profits, from houses of worship and historical buildings to large, private hospitals and universities that may need to retrofit their facilities for energy and water efficiency,” she said.\r\n\r\nTravis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea noted it isn’t every day you see a program that unites the business community and environmentalists. Daugherty, a business owner who advocates for more roads to reduce congestion, and Shea, a well-known environmental activist, were the unlikely duo that promoted passage of the PACE program to their fellow commissioners.\r\n\r\n“I’m proud to have sponsored a program that promotes economic development and protects the needs of the environmental community, which are both so important to Travis County,” said Daugherty.\r\n\r\n“Travis County’s leadership on PACE is proving how to be better stewards of our water, energy and economy,” added Shea.\r\n\r\nLoans acquired through PACE also have a unique characteristic: Should an owner sell the property, the PACE loan is assumed by the buyer. Under conventional lending methods, the property owner is usually required to pay off the loan upon sale of the property.\r\n\r\nIt begins with the Texas PACE Authority, a non-profit organization that helps guide would-be borrowers through the process. Currently, more than $20 million in loans are in the Travis County PACE pipeline, which includes $1.25 million in retrofits that Simon Properties is securing for energy upgrades to Barton Creek Mall.\r\nBut on Wednesday it was all about Congregation Beth Israel being etched in state history as the very first PACE project in Texas.\r\n\r\nIt was a particularly proud moment for Elfant.\r\n\r\n“As the only Jewish tax assessor-collector it gives me great pleasure to announce the first loan under this innovative financing program is going to the synagogue where I’ve been known to show up in the pew every now and then,” he said with a smile.\r\nTo learn more about the PACE program, a list of interested lenders and contractors and whether your business may qualify, go to www.texaspaceauthority.org.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out this article on Texas\' first PACE Lender, Petros PACE Finance:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/\">http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/</a>\r\n\r\nWatch the ceremony here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U9ieyGKkPE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[su_button url=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/Documents/CBI-CaseStudy_Final.pdf?dl=0\" target=\"blank\" style=\"flat\" background=\"#26799C\" size=\"7\" center=\"yes\" radius=\"3\" icon=\"icon: search\"]Download the Case Study[/su_button]\r\n\r\n<br>', 'Congregation Beth Israel Sets the PACE!', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'first-pace-project-in-texas', '', '', '2016-03-21 14:19:18', '2016-03-21 14:19:18', '', '0', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/?p=867', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Skyrocketing energy bills made temple officials realize how much they also needed more insulation for the wall of windows in its auditorium. Price for upgrades: $450,000.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Travis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea along with county Tax Assessor-Collector Bruce Elfant announced in a news conference that Congregation Beth Israel will receive what they need as Texas’ first PACE recipient.\r\n\r\nPACE, which stands for Property Assessed Clean Energy, is an innovative financing program – completely free of government mandates and public funding – that enables non-profit, commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain up to 100 percent of the project financing from low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Repayments of the loans pass through the county tax office to the lenders.\r\n\r\nAustin\'s Petros PACE Finance, LLC, gave Congregation Beth Israel 100 percent of the financing it needed. Petros is one of the first specialty finance firms in the nation dedicated to the commercial PACE market, previously providing financing for PACE projects in Michigan.\r\n\r\n“Closing the first PACE project in our home state is especially significant for us,” said Mansoor Ghori, CEO of Petros PACE Finance, LLC. “We enjoyed working with the team at Congregation Beth Israel and are proud they were the first of many here in Travis County.\"\r\n\r\nThe Way Companies developed the temple project and will replace two air-cooled chilled water machines and two heating water boilers, apply window films and extend the building automation and control system to the new equipment. The improvement will reduce the temple’s operating and utility costs in its educational wing.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Texas Legislature passed the program, which allows local governments to approve its use. The Travis County Commissioners Court became the first government entity in the state to embrace the program in March 2015.\r\n\r\n“It is a credit to the Texas Legislature and the Travis County Commissioners Court that our county is the first in Texas to offer an affordable way for business property owners to reduce their environmental impact and upgrade their properties,” Elfant said. “It is economically beneficial for business and good for the environment, and today it is exciting to publicly announce that Congregation Beth Israel is the first in Texas to take advantage of this program.”\r\n\r\nInstead of shelling out $15,000 a year or more to fix a substandard heating and cooling system, Congregation Beth Israel expects its new upgrades to save $35,000 annually in energy costs.\r\n\r\nRabbi Steven Folberg, the temple’s spiritual leader, recalled a well-known Jewish quote from the Babylonian Talmud that says: You’re not required to complete the work, but neither are you free to abstain from it.\r\n\r\n“While no single individual, organization or community can complete the task of Tikkun Olam, mending and transforming the world, we all must take responsibility and play our part,” Folberg said during the news conference. “Reducing our congregation’s carbon footprint and living with lightened impact on God’s earth through the vision and ingenuity of the PACE program not only makes economic sense, but also represents a sacred act of both responsibility and hope in the future.”\r\n\r\nCharlene Heydinger, executive director of Keeping PACE in Texas, a non-profit business association that led the PACE legislative effort and created the Texas PACE program model, called \"PACE in Box,\" said many people focus on the program\'s value for multi-million-dollar projects for big business.\r\n\r\n“It certainly helps large-scale commercial and industrial property owners with delayed maintenance issues, but it also applies to non-profits, from houses of worship and historical buildings to large, private hospitals and universities that may need to retrofit their facilities for energy and water efficiency,” she said.\r\n\r\nTravis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea noted it isn’t every day you see a program that unites the business community and environmentalists. Daugherty, a business owner who advocates for more roads to reduce congestion, and Shea, a well-known environmental activist, were the unlikely duo that promoted passage of the PACE program to their fellow commissioners.\r\n\r\n“I’m proud to have sponsored a program that promotes economic development and protects the needs of the environmental community, which are both so important to Travis County,” said Daugherty.\r\n\r\n“Travis County’s leadership on PACE is proving how to be better stewards of our water, energy and economy,” added Shea.\r\n\r\nLoans acquired through PACE also have a unique characteristic: Should an owner sell the property, the PACE loan is assumed by the buyer. Under conventional lending methods, the property owner is usually required to pay off the loan upon sale of the property.\r\n\r\nIt begins with the Texas PACE Authority, a non-profit organization that helps guide would-be borrowers through the process. Currently, more than $20 million in loans are in the Travis County PACE pipeline, which includes $1.25 million in retrofits that Simon Properties is securing for energy upgrades to Barton Creek Mall.\r\nBut on Wednesday it was all about Congregation Beth Israel being etched in state history as the very first PACE project in Texas.\r\n\r\nIt was a particularly proud moment for Elfant.\r\n\r\n“As the only Jewish tax assessor-collector it gives me great pleasure to announce the first loan under this innovative financing program is going to the synagogue where I’ve been known to show up in the pew every now and then,” he said with a smile.\r\nTo learn more about the PACE program, a list of interested lenders and contractors and whether your business may qualify, go to www.texaspaceauthority.org.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out this article on Texas\' first PACE Lender, Petros PACE Finance:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/\">http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/</a>\r\n\r\nWatch the ceremony here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U9ieyGKkPE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[su_button url=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/Documents/CBI-CaseStudy_Final.pdf?dl=0\" target=\"blank\" style=\"flat\" background=\"#26799C\" size=\"7\" center=\"yes\" radius=\"3\" icon=\"icon: search\"]Download the Case Study[/su_button]', 'Congregation Beth Israel Sets the PACE!', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '867-autosave-v1', '', '', '2016-03-21 14:18:41', '2016-03-21 14:18:41', '', '867', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/867-autosave-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Skyrocketing energy bills made temple officials realize how much they also needed more insulation for the wall of windows in its auditorium. Price for upgrades: $450,000.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Travis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea along with county Tax Assessor-Collector Bruce Elfant announced in a news conference that Congregation Beth Israel will receive what they need as Texas’ first PACE recipient.\r\n\r\nPACE, which stands for Property Assessed Clean Energy, is an innovative financing program – completely free of government mandates and public funding – that enables non-profit, commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain up to 100 percent of the project financing from low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Repayments of the loans pass through the county tax office to the lenders.\r\n\r\nAustin\'s Petros PACE Finance, LLC, gave Congregation Beth Israel 100 percent of the financing it needed. Petros is one of the first specialty finance firms in the nation dedicated to the commercial PACE market, previously providing financing for PACE projects in Michigan.\r\n\r\n“Closing the first PACE project in our home state is especially significant for us,” said Mansoor Ghori, CEO of Petros PACE Finance, LLC. “We enjoyed working with the team at Congregation Beth Israel and are proud they were the first of many here in Travis County.\"\r\n\r\nThe Way Companies developed the temple project and will replace two air-cooled chilled water machines and two heating water boilers, apply window films and extend the building automation and control system to the new equipment. The improvement will reduce the temple’s operating and utility costs in its educational wing.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Texas Legislature passed the program, which allows local governments to approve its use. The Travis County Commissioners Court became the first government entity in the state to embrace the program in March 2015.\r\n\r\n“It is a credit to the Texas Legislature and the Travis County Commissioners Court that our county is the first in Texas to offer an affordable way for business property owners to reduce their environmental impact and upgrade their properties,” Elfant said. “It is economically beneficial for business and good for the environment, and today it is exciting to publicly announce that Congregation Beth Israel is the first in Texas to take advantage of this program.”\r\n\r\nInstead of shelling out $15,000 a year or more to fix a substandard heating and cooling system, Congregation Beth Israel expects its new upgrades to save $35,000 annually in energy costs.\r\n\r\nRabbi Steven Folberg, the temple’s spiritual leader, recalled a well-known Jewish quote from the Babylonian Talmud that says: You’re not required to complete the work, but neither are you free to abstain from it.\r\n\r\n“While no single individual, organization or community can complete the task of Tikkun Olam, mending and transforming the world, we all must take responsibility and play our part,” Folberg said during the news conference. “Reducing our congregation’s carbon footprint and living with lightened impact on God’s earth through the vision and ingenuity of the PACE program not only makes economic sense, but also represents a sacred act of both responsibility and hope in the future.”\r\n\r\nCharlene Heydinger, executive director of Keeping PACE in Texas, a non-profit business association that led the PACE legislative effort and created the Texas PACE program model, called \"PACE in Box,\" said many people focus on the program\'s value for multi-million-dollar projects for big business.\r\n\r\n“It certainly helps large-scale commercial and industrial property owners with delayed maintenance issues, but it also applies to non-profits, from houses of worship and historical buildings to large, private hospitals and universities that may need to retrofit their facilities for energy and water efficiency,” she said.\r\n\r\nTravis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea noted it isn’t every day you see a program that unites the business community and environmentalists. Daugherty, a business owner who advocates for more roads to reduce congestion, and Shea, a well-known environmental activist, were the unlikely duo that promoted passage of the PACE program to their fellow commissioners.\r\n\r\n“I’m proud to have sponsored a program that promotes economic development and protects the needs of the environmental community, which are both so important to Travis County,” said Daugherty.\r\n\r\n“Travis County’s leadership on PACE is proving how to be better stewards of our water, energy and economy,” added Shea.\r\n\r\nLoans acquired through PACE also have a unique characteristic: Should an owner sell the property, the PACE loan is assumed by the buyer. Under conventional lending methods, the property owner is usually required to pay off the loan upon sale of the property.\r\n\r\nIt begins with the Texas PACE Authority, a non-profit organization that helps guide would-be borrowers through the process. Currently, more than $20 million in loans are in the Travis County PACE pipeline, which includes $1.25 million in retrofits that Simon Properties is securing for energy upgrades to Barton Creek Mall.\r\nBut on Wednesday it was all about Congregation Beth Israel being etched in state history as the very first PACE project in Texas.\r\n\r\nIt was a particularly proud moment for Elfant.\r\n\r\n“As the only Jewish tax assessor-collector it gives me great pleasure to announce the first loan under this innovative financing program is going to the synagogue where I’ve been known to show up in the pew every now and then,” he said with a smile.\r\nTo learn more about the PACE program, a list of interested lenders and contractors and whether your business may qualify, go to www.texaspaceauthority.org.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out this article on Texas\' first PACE Lender, Petros PACE Finance:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/\">http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/</a>\r\n\r\nWatch the ceremony here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U9ieyGKkPE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[su_button url=\"http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/Documents/CBI-CaseStudy_Final.pdf?dl=0\" target=\"blank\" style=\"flat\" background=\"#26799C\" size=\"7\" center=\"yes\" radius=\"3\" icon=\"icon: search\"]Download the Case Study[/su_button]\r\n\r\n<br>', 'Congregation Beth Israel Sets the PACE!', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '867-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-03-21 14:19:18', '2016-03-21 14:19:18', '', '867', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/867-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nThe Texas PACE Authority is a non-profit organization that administers Texas’ new PACE statute by taking a market-based approach to energy finance and economic development. We look forward to working with all parties involved - property owners, contractors, and lenders - in bringing energy and water improvements that are both economically sound and environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\nWhere is PACE Financing available in Texas?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Travis County - April 2015</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://mycity.houstontx.gov/public/\" target=\"_blank\">City of Houston (including ETJ)</a> - November 2015</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInterested in having a PACE program in your area?

Repayments of the loans pass through the county tax office to the lenders.\r\nAustin\'s Petros PACE Finance, LLC, gave Congregation Beth Israel 100 percent of the financing it needed. Petros is one of the first specialty finance firms in the nation dedicated to the commercial PACE market, previously providing financing for PACE projects in Michigan.\r\n\r\n“Closing the first PACE project in our home state is especially significant for us,” said Mansoor Ghori, CEO of Petros PACE Finance, LLC. “We enjoyed working with the team at Congregation Beth Israel and are proud they were the first of many here in Travis County.\"\r\n\r\nThe Way Companies developed the temple project and will replace two air-cooled chilled water machines and two heating water boilers, apply window films and extend the building automation and control system to the new equipment. The improvement will reduce the temple’s operating and utility costs in its educational wing.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Texas Legislature passed the program, which allows local governments to approve its use. The Travis County Commissioners Court became the first government entity in the state to embrace the program in March 2015.\r\n\r\n“It is a credit to the Texas Legislature and the Travis County Commissioners Court that our county is the first in Texas to offer an affordable way for business property owners to reduce their environmental impact and upgrade their properties,” Elfant said. “It is economically beneficial for business and good for the environment, and today it is exciting to publicly announce that Congregation Beth Israel is the first in Texas to take advantage of this program.”\r\nInstead of shelling out $15,000 a year or more to fix a substandard heating and cooling system, Congregation Beth Israel expects its new upgrades to save $35,000 annually in energy costs.\r\n\r\nRabbi Steven Folberg, the temple’s spiritual leader, recalled a well-known Jewish quote from the Babylonian Talmud that says: You’re not required to complete the work, but neither are you free to abstain from it.\r\n“While no single individual, organization or community can complete the task of Tikkun Olam, mending and transforming the world, we all must take responsibility and play our part,” Folberg said during the news conference. “Reducing our congregation’s carbon footprint and living with lightened impact on God’s earth through the vision and ingenuity of the PACE program not only makes economic sense, but also represents a sacred act of both responsibility and hope in the future.”\r\n\r\nCharlene Heydinger, executive director of Keeping PACE in Texas, a non-profit business association that led the PACE legislative effort and created the Texas PACE program model, called \"PACE in Box,\" said many people focus on the program\'s value for multi-million-dollar projects for big business.\r\n“It certainly helps large-scale commercial and industrial property owners with delayed maintenance issues, but it also applies to non-profits, from houses of worship and historical buildings to large, private hospitals and universities that may need to retrofit their facilities for energy and water efficiency,” she said.\r\nTravis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea noted it isn’t every day you see a program that unites the business community and environmentalists. Daugherty, a business owner who advocates for more roads to reduce congestion, and Shea, a well-known environmental activist, were the unlikely duo that promoted passage of the PACE program to their fellow commissioners.\r\n\r\n“I’m proud to have sponsored a program that promotes economic development and protects the needs of the environmental community, which are both so important to Travis County,” said Daugherty.\r\n\r\n“Travis County’s leadership on PACE is proving how to be better stewards of our water, energy and economy,” added Shea.\r\nLoans acquired through PACE also have a unique characteristic: Should an owner sell the property, the PACE loan is assumed by the buyer. Under conventional lending methods, the property owner is usually required to pay off the loan upon sale of the property.\r\nIt begins with the Texas PACE Authority, a non-profit organization that helps guide would-be borrowers through the process. Currently, more than $20 million in loans are in the Travis County PACE pipeline, which includes $1.25 million in retrofits that Simon Properties is securing for energy upgrades to Barton Creek Mall.\r\nBut on Wednesday it was all about Congregation Beth Israel being etched in state history as the very first PACE project in Texas.\r\n\r\nIt was a particularly proud moment for Elfant.\r\n“As the only Jewish tax assessor-collector it gives me great pleasure to announce the first loan under this innovative financing program is going to the synagogue where I’ve been known to show up in the pew every now and then,” he said with a smile.\r\nTo learn more about the PACE program, a list of interested lenders and contractors and whether your business may qualify, go to www.texaspaceauthority.org.\r\n\r\nAlso, check out this article on Texas\' first PACE Lender, Petros PACE Finance:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/\">http://www.mystatesman.com/news/business/state-financing-allows-congregation-to-move-on-cle/nqW8Z/</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Congregation Beth Israel Sets the PACE!', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '867-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-24 21:36:12', '2016-02-24 21:36:12', '', '867', 'http://www.texaspaceauthority.org/867-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Skyrocketing energy bills made temple officials realize how much they also needed more insulation for the wall of windows in its auditorium. Price for upgrades: $450,000.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Travis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea along with county Tax Assessor-Collector Bruce Elfant announced in a news conference that Congregation Beth Israel will receive what they need as Texas’ first PACE recipient.\r\n\r\nPACE, which stands for Property Assessed Clean Energy, is an innovative financing program – completely free of government mandates and public funding – that enables non-profit, commercial, industrial, multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain up to 100 percent of the project financing from low-cost, long-term loans for water conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Repayments of the loans pass through the county tax office to the lenders.\r\n\r\nAustin\'s Petros PACE Finance, LLC, gave Congregation Beth Israel 100 percent of the financing it needed. Petros is one of the first specialty finance firms in the nation dedicated to the commercial PACE market, previously providing financing for PACE projects in Michigan.\r\n\r\n“Closing the first PACE project in our home state is especially significant for us,” said Mansoor Ghori, CEO of Petros PACE Finance, LLC. “We enjoyed working with the team at Congregation Beth Israel and are proud they were the first of many here in Travis County.\"\r\n\r\nThe Way Companies developed the temple project and will replace two air-cooled chilled water machines and two heating water boilers, apply window films and extend the building automation and control system to the new equipment. The improvement will reduce the temple’s operating and utility costs in its educational wing.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Texas Legislature passed the program, which allows local governments to approve its use. The Travis County Commissioners Court became the first government entity in the state to embrace the program in March 2015.\r\n\r\n“It is a credit to the Texas Legislature and the Travis County Commissioners Court that our county is the first in Texas to offer an affordable way for business property owners to reduce their environmental impact and upgrade their properties,” Elfant said. “It is economically beneficial for business and good for the environment, and today it is exciting to publicly announce that Congregation Beth Israel is the first in Texas to take advantage of this program.”\r\n\r\nInstead of shelling out $15,000 a year or more to fix a substandard heating and cooling system, Congregation Beth Israel expects its new upgrades to save $35,000 annually in energy costs.\r\n\r\nRabbi Steven Folberg, the temple’s spiritual leader, recalled a well-known Jewish quote from the Babylonian Talmud that says: You’re not required to complete the work, but neither are you free to abstain from it.\r\n\r\n“While no single individual, organization or community can complete the task of Tikkun Olam, mending and transforming the world, we all must take responsibility and play our part,” Folberg said during the news conference. “Reducing our congregation’s carbon footprint and living with lightened impact on God’s earth through the vision and ingenuity of the PACE program not only makes economic sense, but also represents a sacred act of both responsibility and hope in the future.”\r\n\r\nCharlene Heydinger, executive director of Keeping PACE in Texas, a non-profit business association that led the PACE legislative effort and created the Texas PACE program model, called \"PACE in Box,\" said many people focus on the program\'s value for multi-million-dollar projects for big business.\r\n\r\n“It certainly helps large-scale commercial and industrial property owners with delayed maintenance issues, but it also applies to non-profits, from houses of worship and historical buildings to large, private hospitals and universities that may need to retrofit their facilities for energy and water efficiency,” she said.\r\n\r\nTravis County commissioners Gerald Daugherty and Brigid Shea noted it isn’t every day you see a program that unites the business community and environmentalists. Daugherty, a business owner who advocates for more roads to reduce congestion, and Shea, a well-known environmental activist, were the unlikely duo that promoted passage of the PACE program to their fellow commissioners.\r\n\r\n“I’m proud to have sponsored a program that promotes economic development and protects the needs of the environmental community, which are both so important to Travis County,” said Daugherty.\r\n\r\n“Travis County’s leadership on PACE is proving how to be better stewards of our water, energy and economy,” added Shea.\r\n\r\nLoans acquired through PACE also have a unique characteristic: Should an owner sell the property, the PACE loan is assumed by the buyer.

We\'re facilitating an open-market PACE initiative in Texas to make property more energy and water efficient.\r\n\r\nPACE is an innovative financing program that offers a new way to upgrade commercial buildings using:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>100% financing</li>\r\n	<li>Project pays for itself by decreasing the building\'s operating costs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPACE enables commercial, industrial, large multi-family, and agricultural property owners to obtain low-cost, long-term financing for water conservation, energy- efficiency, and renewable energy projects. Participants will then repay those loans through a property assessment imposed by the local government at the request of the property owner.\r\n\r\nPACE has great potential to directly affect a business\' bottom lines; a project\'s savings in utility costs offsets the cost of installing the project. In most instances, this will result in an immediate positive cash flow. This mechanism can be used to equip buildings with the latest in efficiency technology, including lighting, HVAC, and water conservation tools. In addition, PACE can be used for renewable energy additions, such as roof-top solar panels.\r\n\r\nThe Texas PACE Authority is a non-profit organization that administers Texas’ new PACE statute by taking a market-based approach to energy finance and economic development. We look forward to working with all parties involved - property owners, contractors, and lenders - in bringing energy and water improvements that are both economically sound and environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\nWhere is PACE Financing available in Texas?\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Travis County - April 2015</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://mycity.houstontx.gov/public/\" target=\"_blank\">City of Houston (including ETJ)</a> - November 2015</li>\r\n	<li>Williamson County - April 2016</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nInterested in having a PACE program in your area?
